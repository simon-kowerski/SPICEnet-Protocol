// poll for incoming packet OR send request


// if recieved an incoming packet
    // check if its a valid packet
    // if not request it again
    // check if its the next one in sequence
    // if not request it again
    // maybe ack
    // then forward the data to the proper port/APID
    
// when sending a packet
    // encapsulate data with some sort of counter and crc bit
    // forward to sndlp





// call connect - transport layer
    // throws an error if network isn't initalized
    // give it your apid
    // returns a fd you can read from and write to for application specific data



// when users write to their fds it will get caught by a poll and then sent by the send client
// when data comes in for a specific apid it will get written to the fd for that apid, or discarded if one is not open


// ******************
//have a lock for reading and a lock for writing so that you can ensure all data is read or written in order
