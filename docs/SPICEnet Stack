Application Layer 
- all of the applications
- main application is the 

Presentation Layer
- Not implemented
- Compression and Encryption
- Probably to be impemented by applications

SPICEnet Session Protocol (SNSP)
- Provide a user interface for network interface (API)
- read, write, connect (open AND verify connection - to replace sndlp_connect)
    - sends to transport protocol first
    - not going to be doing a lot of the work on its own, simiply to make it look nicer
- init() which will initialize the entire protocol in the main thread
    - call spp_init
    - 

SPICEnet Transport Protocol (SNTP)
- When reading, ensure all packets are recieved and correct
- Request retransmission
- Maintain records of all packets that may need to be retransmitted
    - Records removed when it is known they have been recieved
- Maybe similar to COP-1 idk
- Will need to ensapuslate packets further before sending it to sndlp
    - include crc checks and others 
- SPICEnet Driver (APID 1) 
    - Responsible for all reading all network traffic, and relaying the data to other APIDs

Network Layer 
- None

SPICEnet Data Link Protocol SPDLP
- Open connection (sndlp_open)
- Read data (sndlp_read)
- Write data (sndlp_write)
- Packetization (ccsds spp)

Physical Layer
- RS422 serial
